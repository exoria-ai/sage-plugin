# Proposition 13 and Assessed Values

## Overview

Proposition 13 (1978) fundamentally changed California property taxation. Understanding Prop 13 is essential for interpreting assessed values, which are NOT the same as market values.

## Core Provisions

### Base Year Value
- Property is assessed at market value upon acquisition (purchase, new construction)
- This becomes the "base year value"
- Date of acquisition establishes the assessment baseline

### 2% Annual Increase Cap
- Assessed value can increase maximum 2% per year
- Actual increase is inflation adjustment (CPI) up to 2%
- Many years the increase is less than 2%

### Result
Long-held properties often have assessed values FAR below market value:
- Property purchased in 1980 for $100,000
- 2024 assessed value might be ~$250,000 (with 2% annual increases)
- 2024 market value might be $800,000+

## Reassessment Triggers

### Change in Ownership
Most ownership changes trigger reassessment to current market value:
- Sale (most common)
- Gift (with exceptions)
- Trust distributions (with exceptions)
- Corporate/partnership changes

### Exclusions from Reassessment
Some transfers do NOT trigger reassessment:
- **Parent-child** (Prop 19 limits apply after 2/16/21)
- **Grandparent-grandchild** (if parent deceased, with limits)
- **Spouse to spouse** (death or divorce)
- **Revocable trust transfers**
- **Joint tenancy between original parties**

### New Construction
- Completed new construction assessed at market value
- Additions assessed separately, added to existing base
- Remodels may or may not trigger (depends on scope)

## Proposition 8 Reductions

### Temporary Declines
If market value falls BELOW assessed value:
- Assessor can reduce assessed value temporarily
- Called "Prop 8 reduction" or "decline in value"
- Reassessed annually until market recovers

### Recovery
As market recovers:
- Assessed value can increase more than 2% annually
- BUT cannot exceed "factored base year value"
- Once recovered, normal 2% cap resumes

## Reading Assessment Records

### Land Value
- Value of land only
- Subject to Prop 13 rules
- Reassessed upon trigger events

### Improvement Value
- Value of structures/improvements
- Subject to Prop 13 rules
- New construction adds to base

### Total Assessed Value
- Land + Improvements
- Basis for property tax calculation
- Tax rate is approximately 1% + voter-approved bonds/assessments

### Base Year
- Year of last reassessment event
- Look at this to understand property history
- Old base year = long-term ownership

## Common Scenarios

### Recent Purchase
- Assessed value ≈ purchase price
- Check if "pending supplemental" assessment
- Future increases capped at 2%

### Long-term Owner
- Assessed value << market value
- Low tax basis is valuable
- Transfer will trigger reassessment

### Inherited Property (Pre-Prop 19)
- May have inherited parent's low basis
- Applies to principal residence + $1M other property
- Very valuable tax benefit

### Inherited Property (Post-Prop 19)
After February 16, 2021:
- Principal residence only (if child uses as their residence)
- Assessed value adjusted to current, with $1M exclusion
- Significantly limited benefit compared to before

### Business Properties
- Different rules may apply
- Corporate ownership changes can trigger
- Prop 13 split roll discussions ongoing

## Tax Calculation

Basic formula:
```
Property Tax = Assessed Value × Tax Rate
```

Tax rate components:
- Base rate: 1%
- Voter-approved bonds: varies by location
- Direct assessments: varies by district

Typical effective rate: 1.1% - 1.4%

### Supplemental Tax Bills
After reassessment:
- Supplemental bill covers difference
- Prorated from reassessment date to fiscal year end
- Separate from regular annual bill

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my assessed value so much lower than what Zillow shows?**
A: Assessed value is based on your purchase price (or last reassessment) plus maximum 2%/year increases. Market estimates reflect current conditions. They serve different purposes.

**Q: If I add a room, will my whole property be reassessed?**
A: No. Only the new construction is assessed at current value and added to your existing base. Your original structure keeps its Prop 13 protected value.

**Q: Can I appeal my assessment?**
A: Yes. If you believe your assessed value exceeds current market value (not comparing to other properties' assessed values), you can file an assessment appeal with the county.

**Q: Does refinancing trigger reassessment?**
A: No. Refinancing is not a change in ownership. Your assessed value is unaffected.

**Q: What about adding a family member to title?**
A: This could trigger partial reassessment depending on the arrangement. Consult a tax professional before making title changes.

## Practical Implications

### For Property Information Queries
When providing assessed values:
1. Note the base year
2. Explain that assessed ≠ market value
3. Mention Prop 13 if there's a large disparity
4. Don't use assessed value for market estimates

### For Buyers
- Expect property taxes to increase after purchase
- Use purchase price × ~1.2% for rough tax estimate
- Account for supplemental tax bill in first year

### For Sellers
- Your low tax basis transfers to you, not the buyer
- Buyer's taxes will be based on sale price
- This is not a negotiation point
