## Meeting Tools

### list_committees
List all available committees with meeting counts and date ranges.

```
list_committees()
→ Returns: committee IDs, names, meeting counts, date ranges
```

### list_meetings
List meetings for a committee or year.

```
list_meetings({ committee: "bos", year: 2025 })
→ Returns: meeting IDs, dates, has_agenda, has_minutes, is_special_meeting
```

### search_meeting_minutes
Search across all meeting content with keyword matching.

```
search_meeting_minutes({
  query: "budget",
  committee: "bos",           // optional: "bos", "regis", or full name
  document_type: "minutes",   // optional: "agenda" or "minutes"
  date_from: "2025-01-01",    // optional
  date_to: "2025-12-31",      // optional
  top_k: 10                   // optional, default 10

**Search Tips:**

- Use date ranges to focus on recent meetings
- Search minutes for decisions/votes, agendas for upcoming items

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Research Board Actions
Find what the Board decided on a topic:

1. `search_meeting_minutes` → "topic" with committee: "bos", document_type: "minutes"
2. `get_meeting_chunk` → Full text of relevant items
3. Cross-reference with budget or code if needed

### Pattern 2: Track Project History
Follow a topic across multiple meetings:

1. `search_meeting_minutes` → broad search, no date filter
2. Review results chronologically
3. `get_meeting` for key meetings with detailed discussion

### Pattern 3: Prepare for Board Meeting
Research upcoming agenda items:

1. `list_meetings` → Find most recent meeting with agenda
2. `get_meeting` → document_type: "agenda"
3. Search past meetings for related decisions

### Pattern 4: Connect Policy to Decisions
Link General Plan/Code to Board actions:

1. `search_general_plan` or `search_county_code` → Find policy
2. `search_meeting_minutes` → Search for policy topic in BOS minutes
3. Explain: Policy intent → Board action → Implementation
