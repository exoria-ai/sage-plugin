## Quick Orientation Tips

**"Between the Bay and Sacramento"** - Solano is the connector county. I-80 traffic heading from SF to Sacramento passes through the entire county.

**West = Hills & Bay, East = Flat & Delta** - Terrain transitions from Vaca Mountain foothills and bay wetlands in the west to Central Valley flatlands and Sacramento River Delta in the east.

**Travis AFB dominates central county** - The base and its operations significantly influence Fairfield and surrounding areas. Flight paths, noise zones, and economic impact are major factors.

**Water everywhere in the south** - Suisun Marsh, Suisun Bay, and the Delta make the southern/eastern portions very wet. Flood zones and marsh regulations are common.
