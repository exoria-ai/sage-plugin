## History

### Indigenous Peoples and Pre-Colonial Era

The Patwin, a southern branch of the Wintun people, were the primary indigenous inhabitants of the region prior to European contact, with archaeological evidence indicating human occupation dating back at least to 2000 BCE in areas such as Green Valley. Their territory extended across the Sacramento Valley lowlands and adjacent hills, including villages situated along waterways like the Sacramento River and Suisun Creek.

Patwin subsistence relied on a diversified economy of hunting, fishing, and gathering, with acorns serving as a staple food. Archaeological sites reveal tool assemblages of stone knives, anvils, and baskets, alongside evidence of regional trade for marine shells and obsidian.

### European Settlement and 19th-Century Development

European settlement commenced under Mexican rule in Alta California, with large ranchos dominating land use. Rancho Suisun was provisionally awarded in 1837 and legally confirmed in 1842 to Francisco Solano, the Suisun tribal leader allied with Mexican authorities.

Solano County was formally established on February 18, 1850, carved primarily from the northern portion of Napa County. The county seat was initially placed at Benicia, founded in December 1847. Benicia served as California's third state capital from February 1853 to July 1854.

The 19th-century economy pivoted to export-oriented agriculture. By the 1860s, county farms produced substantial wheat harvests exceeding 500,000 bushels annually.

### Military Establishment and 20th-Century Growth

Construction of Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Base (later Travis Air Force Base) began in June 1942. The base activated on May 11, 1943, facilitating the deployment for Pacific theater operations.

Mare Island Naval Shipyard reached its zenith in mid-20th century, employing up to 46,000 civilians during World War II and repairing or overhauling 1,227 vessels. The shipyard closed in 1996.

Post-World War II, the county's population increased dramatically:
- 1940: 49,118
- 1950: 103,197
- 1960: 134,597
- 1970: 174,444
