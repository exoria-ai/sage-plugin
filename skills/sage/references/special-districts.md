## Common Questions

### "Who provides my fire protection?"
Use the `get_special_districts` tool with your location - it queries the fire district boundaries to find your provider.

### "Do I need to connect to public sewer?"
- **In cities**: Usually required connection
- **Unincorporated areas**: Usually private septic
- Environmental Health determines requirements

### "Who do I call about water?"
Depends on location:
1. **City water**: Contact your city
2. **SID service area**: Solano Irrigation District
3. **Private well**: You're responsible (permit from Environmental Health)

### "Can I subdivide my land?"
District capacity affects subdivision approval:
- Fire district must confirm adequate service
- Water supply must be verified
- School impact fees may apply
- Road improvements may be required
