## Common Questions

### "What can I build?"
Zoning determines what uses are *potentially* allowed. Building still requires:
1. Building permit from Building & Safety
2. Possibly a use permit (AP, MUP, or UP)
3. Environmental review if applicable
4. Other agency approvals (fire, health, etc.)

### "Can I have animals?"
Agricultural zones generally allow:
- A-40, A-80, A-160: Unrestricted agricultural animals
- A-20: Agricultural animals with some limits
- R-R zones: Limited livestock, typically horses and small animals

### "Can I build a second dwelling?"
- Agricultural zones: "Secondary dwelling" rules apply (different from ADU)
- R-R zones: May allow ADUs under state law
- Always verify with Planning: (707) 784-6765

### "Can I operate a business?"
Home occupations may be permitted with restrictions on:
- Client visits
- Signage
- Employees
- Outdoor storage
- Hours of operation

Check specific zoning regulations or contact Planning.
