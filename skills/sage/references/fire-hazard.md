# CAL FIRE Fire Hazard Severity Zone Guide

## Overview

Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ) are mapped by CAL FIRE and the State Board of Forestry. They classify areas based on the **potential fire behavior** (hazard), not the probability of fire occurring (risk).

## Response Guidelines for FHSZ Questions

### Grounding Principle
When explaining FHSZ designations, ALWAYS defer to CAL FIRE's official methodology. Do NOT claim to independently analyze terrain or vegetation - instead, explain what factors CAL FIRE's model considers and how they might apply to the visible landscape.

### What You CAN Do
- Report the official FHSZ designation from GIS data
- Explain CAL FIRE's published methodology (see Model Inputs below)
- Describe observable landscape features that ALIGN WITH the official classification
- Provide building code and defensible space requirements that apply
- Direct users to official appeal/comment processes

### What You CANNOT Do
- Independently determine why a specific parcel received its rating
- Override or second-guess CAL FIRE's official classification
- Predict how a rating might change
- Advise on insurance decisions (insurers use different risk models)
- Make official determinations about code compliance

### Deferential Language Patterns

**WRONG** (claiming independent analysis):
> "Looking at the terrain, I can see why your property is rated Very High - the steep slopes and dense vegetation clearly indicate extreme fire behavior potential."

**RIGHT** (grounded in official methodology):
> "Your property is officially classified as Very High FHSZ by CAL FIRE. According to CAL FIRE's published methodology, the model considers factors including slope, fuel loading, fire weather patterns, and wind. Looking at the map, you can see this area has characteristics consistent with those factors - the terrain shows significant slopes and the western orientation may contribute to fire weather exposure. For questions about your specific classification, you can contact CAL FIRE at FHSZinformation@fire.ca.gov or (916) 633-7655."

### Visual Reasoning with Maps
When rendering maps with fire hazard overlays, use observations to ILLUSTRATE the official classification, not to justify it:

**Appropriate framing:**
> "The fire hazard overlay shows your parcel (blue) is in the Moderate zone. You can see on the map that the Very High zones (red) follow the steep canyon terrain to the west, while your property sits on the flatter valley floor. This pattern aligns with CAL FIRE's methodology, which weights slope heavily in its hazard calculations."

**Not appropriate:**
> "I analyzed the terrain and determined your property should be Moderate because the slopes are gentler than the areas to the west."

### Official Appeal/Comment Process
Property owners who disagree with their FHSZ classification can:
1. Email: FHSZinformation@fire.ca.gov
2. Phone: (916) 633-7655
3. Note: Local agencies cannot DECREASE zone levels below state recommendations; they can only accept or increase them (Gov. Code 51179)

### Insurance Caveat
Always include when FHSZ relates to insurance questions:
> "Note: Insurance companies use their own proprietary risk models, which differ from CAL FIRE's hazard model. FHSZ classification alone does not determine insurance rates or availability. Contact your insurance provider for coverage questions."

## Key Distinction: Hazard vs. Risk

### Fire Hazard
- Based on physical conditions: terrain, vegetation, weather
- Describes HOW a fire would behave if ignited
- Does NOT consider ignition probability

### Fire Risk
- Probability that a fire will occur
- Includes ignition sources (human activity, lightning)
- Combined with hazard for overall fire danger

**FHSZ maps HAZARD, not RISK.** A remote area with high hazard may have low risk due to few ignition sources. A moderate hazard urban-wildland interface may have higher risk due to human activity.

## Responsibility Areas

### State Responsibility Area (SRA)
- CAL FIRE has primary fire protection responsibility
- Typically unincorporated wildland areas
- FHSZ classifications: Moderate, High, Very High
- State fire safe regulations apply (PRC 4291)

### Local Responsibility Area (LRA)
- City or fire district has primary responsibility
- Incorporated areas and some unincorporated urban areas
- FHSZ classifications: designated by local agency
- Local fire safe regulations may apply

### Federal Responsibility Area (FRA)
- Federal agency has primary responsibility
- National forests, parks, military bases
- Not typically mapped in FHSZ

## FHSZ Classifications

### Moderate
- **Fire behavior**: Lower intensity, slower spread
- **Terrain**: Gentle slopes, less complex
- **Vegetation**: Less dense, lower fuel loads
- **Requirements**: Standard building codes
- **Defensible space**: 100 feet recommended

### High
- **Fire behavior**: Significant intensity, moderate spread rate
- **Terrain**: Moderate slopes, some complexity
- **Vegetation**: Moderate density fuels
- **Requirements**: Enhanced building standards may apply
- **Defensible space**: 100 feet required in SRA

### Very High (VHFHSZ)
- **Fire behavior**: Extreme intensity, rapid spread, ember production
- **Terrain**: Steep slopes, complex terrain
- **Vegetation**: Dense, continuous fuels
- **Requirements**: Chapter 7A building standards required
- **Defensible space**: 100 feet required, strictly enforced

## Building Requirements

### Chapter 7A (California Building Code)
Applies to new construction in VHFHSZ and sometimes High FHSZ:

- **Roofing**: Class A fire-rated
- **Eaves**: Enclosed or fire-resistant
- **Vents**: Ember-resistant (1/8" mesh or approved type)
- **Exterior walls**: Ignition-resistant materials
- **Windows**: Dual-pane or tempered glass
- **Decks**: Ignition-resistant materials within 10 feet of structure
- **Fencing**: Non-combustible within 5 feet of structure

### When Chapter 7A Applies
- New construction in VHFHSZ (SRA or LRA)
- Additions/alterations exceeding threshold
- Local agencies may extend to High FHSZ

## Defensible Space Requirements

### Zone 0: Ember-Resistant Zone (0-5 feet)
- Most restrictive, nearest to structure
- No combustible materials, debris, dead vegetation
- Use hardscape, fire-resistant plants
- Required in VHFHSZ, recommended elsewhere

### Zone 1: Lean, Clean, and Green (0-30 feet)
- Remove dead vegetation, debris
- Space trees, trim lower branches
- Keep grass mowed to 4 inches
- Remove ladder fuels

### Zone 2: Reduced Fuel Zone (30-100 feet)
- Create horizontal and vertical spacing
- Reduce density of vegetation
- Remove dead wood and debris
- Create fuel breaks

### PRC 4291 (State Law)
In SRA and certain LRA:
- 100 feet defensible space required
- Annual inspection may occur
- Violations can result in fines
- Liability for fire suppression costs possible

## Insurance Implications

### FAIR Plan
Properties in VHFHSZ may have difficulty obtaining standard insurance:
- California FAIR Plan provides basic fire coverage
- May need Difference in Conditions policy for full coverage
- Rates typically higher than standard market

### Mitigation Credits
Some insurers offer discounts for:
- Maintaining defensible space
- Fire-resistant construction
- Community fire protection plans
- Home hardening improvements

## Solano County Fire Hazard Context

### SRA Areas
Much of rural Solano County is SRA, including:
- Suisun Marsh vicinity
- Eastern hills
- Green Valley area
- Vaca Mountains foothills

### Urban-Wildland Interface
Critical areas where development meets wildland:
- Vallejo hills
- American Canyon border
- Green Valley / Rockville
- Vacaville outskirts

### Recent Fire History
- 2020 LNU Lightning Complex: Massive fire in region
- Recurring grass fires in dry season
- Increasing fire season length due to climate

## Common Questions

**Q: My property is mapped as Very High FHSZ but it's surrounded by development. Why?**
A: FHSZ is based on vegetation, terrain, and weather analysis, not surrounding development. Even urban-adjacent areas can have high hazard based on fuel and topography.

**Q: Do I need to comply with Chapter 7A if I'm remodeling?**
A: Depends on the scope. Generally, if the work is a substantial improvement (>50% of value) or involves exterior components, Chapter 7A may apply. Check with your Building Department.

**Q: Can my FHSZ classification change?**
A: Yes, but it's rare. CAL FIRE updates maps periodically. Local agencies can adopt different classifications for LRA. Major vegetation removal doesn't typically change classification.

**Q: What if I can't achieve 100 feet of clearance?**
A: Small lots may not allow full 100 feet. Focus on Zone 0 and Zone 1. Work with your fire department on alternative compliance. Document your efforts.

**Q: Does FHSZ affect my property value?**
A: Potentially. Insurance costs, building restrictions, and buyer perception can all be affected. However, many desirable areas are in VHFHSZ.

## CAL FIRE Model Inputs (Technical Reference)

The FHSZ model is developed under Public Resources Code 4201-4204 (SRA) and Government Code 51175-89 (LRA). CAL FIRE uses a science-based model with these specific inputs:

### Primary Factors
| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Fuel Loading | Type and amount of vegetation (current AND projected over 30-50 years) |
| Slope | Fire burns faster and more intensely uphill |
| Fire Weather | Temperature, humidity, wind patterns typical for the area |
| Wind | Areas where wind has been identified as major cause of wildfire spread |
| Fire History | Past fire occurrence patterns |
| Predicted Flame Length | Expected fire intensity |
| Ember Transport | How far burning embers can travel (up to 1 mile ahead of fire) |
| Crown Fire Potential | Whether fire can reach treetops under extreme conditions |

### Important Technical Notes
1. **Time Horizon**: FHSZ considers a 30-50 year period, including potential future vegetation changes
2. **Extreme Conditions**: Model uses extreme (not average) fuel and weather scenarios
3. **No Mitigation Credit**: Defensible space and fire-resistant construction do NOT reduce your FHSZ - they reduce your actual risk but not the mapped hazard
4. **Zone Homogeneity**: Zones group "relatively homogeneous lands" - similar burn probability and fire behavior within each zone

### Legal Process
1. CAL FIRE develops maps using the model above
2. For SRA: Direct adoption by State Fire Marshal
3. For LRA: State Fire Marshal recommends, local agencies must adopt within 120 days
4. Maps follow Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approval
5. Local agencies CANNOT decrease zones below state recommendation (Gov. Code 51179)
