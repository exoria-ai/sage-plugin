# CAL FIRE Fire Hazard Severity Zone Guide

## Overview

Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ) are mapped by CAL FIRE and the State Board of Forestry. They classify areas based on the **potential fire behavior** (hazard), not the probability of fire occurring (risk).

## Key Distinction: Hazard vs. Risk

### Fire Hazard
- Based on physical conditions: terrain, vegetation, weather
- Describes HOW a fire would behave if ignited
- Does NOT consider ignition probability

### Fire Risk
- Probability that a fire will occur
- Includes ignition sources (human activity, lightning)
- Combined with hazard for overall fire danger

**FHSZ maps HAZARD, not RISK.** A remote area with high hazard may have low risk due to few ignition sources. A moderate hazard urban-wildland interface may have higher risk due to human activity.

## Responsibility Areas

### State Responsibility Area (SRA)
- CAL FIRE has primary fire protection responsibility
- Typically unincorporated wildland areas
- FHSZ classifications: Moderate, High, Very High
- State fire safe regulations apply (PRC 4291)

### Local Responsibility Area (LRA)
- City or fire district has primary responsibility
- Incorporated areas and some unincorporated urban areas
- FHSZ classifications: designated by local agency
- Local fire safe regulations may apply

### Federal Responsibility Area (FRA)
- Federal agency has primary responsibility
- National forests, parks, military bases
- Not typically mapped in FHSZ

## FHSZ Classifications

### Moderate
- **Fire behavior**: Lower intensity, slower spread
- **Terrain**: Gentle slopes, less complex
- **Vegetation**: Less dense, lower fuel loads
- **Requirements**: Standard building codes
- **Defensible space**: 100 feet recommended

### High
- **Fire behavior**: Significant intensity, moderate spread rate
- **Terrain**: Moderate slopes, some complexity
- **Vegetation**: Moderate density fuels
- **Requirements**: Enhanced building standards may apply
- **Defensible space**: 100 feet required in SRA

### Very High (VHFHSZ)
- **Fire behavior**: Extreme intensity, rapid spread, ember production
- **Terrain**: Steep slopes, complex terrain
- **Vegetation**: Dense, continuous fuels
- **Requirements**: Chapter 7A building standards required
- **Defensible space**: 100 feet required, strictly enforced

## Building Requirements

### Chapter 7A (California Building Code)
Applies to new construction in VHFHSZ and sometimes High FHSZ:

- **Roofing**: Class A fire-rated
- **Eaves**: Enclosed or fire-resistant
- **Vents**: Ember-resistant (1/8" mesh or approved type)
- **Exterior walls**: Ignition-resistant materials
- **Windows**: Dual-pane or tempered glass
- **Decks**: Ignition-resistant materials within 10 feet of structure
- **Fencing**: Non-combustible within 5 feet of structure

### When Chapter 7A Applies
- New construction in VHFHSZ (SRA or LRA)
- Additions/alterations exceeding threshold
- Local agencies may extend to High FHSZ

## Defensible Space Requirements

### Zone 0: Ember-Resistant Zone (0-5 feet)
- Most restrictive, nearest to structure
- No combustible materials, debris, dead vegetation
- Use hardscape, fire-resistant plants
- Required in VHFHSZ, recommended elsewhere

### Zone 1: Lean, Clean, and Green (0-30 feet)
- Remove dead vegetation, debris
- Space trees, trim lower branches
- Keep grass mowed to 4 inches
- Remove ladder fuels

### Zone 2: Reduced Fuel Zone (30-100 feet)
- Create horizontal and vertical spacing
- Reduce density of vegetation
- Remove dead wood and debris
- Create fuel breaks

### PRC 4291 (State Law)
In SRA and certain LRA:
- 100 feet defensible space required
- Annual inspection may occur
- Violations can result in fines
- Liability for fire suppression costs possible

## Insurance Implications

### FAIR Plan
Properties in VHFHSZ may have difficulty obtaining standard insurance:
- California FAIR Plan provides basic fire coverage
- May need Difference in Conditions policy for full coverage
- Rates typically higher than standard market

### Mitigation Credits
Some insurers offer discounts for:
- Maintaining defensible space
- Fire-resistant construction
- Community fire protection plans
- Home hardening improvements

## Solano County Fire Hazard Context

### SRA Areas
Much of rural Solano County is SRA, including:
- Suisun Marsh vicinity
- Eastern hills
- Green Valley area
- Vaca Mountains foothills

### Urban-Wildland Interface
Critical areas where development meets wildland:
- Vallejo hills
- American Canyon border
- Green Valley / Rockville
- Vacaville outskirts

### Recent Fire History
- 2020 LNU Lightning Complex: Massive fire in region
- Recurring grass fires in dry season
- Increasing fire season length due to climate

## Common Questions

**Q: My property is mapped as Very High FHSZ but it's surrounded by development. Why?**
A: FHSZ is based on vegetation, terrain, and weather analysis, not surrounding development. Even urban-adjacent areas can have high hazard based on fuel and topography.

**Q: Do I need to comply with Chapter 7A if I'm remodeling?**
A: Depends on the scope. Generally, if the work is a substantial improvement (>50% of value) or involves exterior components, Chapter 7A may apply. Check with your Building Department.

**Q: Can my FHSZ classification change?**
A: Yes, but it's rare. CAL FIRE updates maps periodically. Local agencies can adopt different classifications for LRA. Major vegetation removal doesn't typically change classification.

**Q: What if I can't achieve 100 feet of clearance?**
A: Small lots may not allow full 100 feet. Focus on Zone 0 and Zone 1. Work with your fire department on alternative compliance. Document your efforts.

**Q: Does FHSZ affect my property value?**
A: Potentially. Insurance costs, building restrictions, and buyer perception can all be affected. However, many desirable areas are in VHFHSZ.
