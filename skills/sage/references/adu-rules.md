# ADU Rules in Solano County

Quick reference for Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) and Junior ADUs (JADUs) in unincorporated Solano County.

## Key Distinction: ADUs vs. Secondary Dwellings

**ADUs** (per California Government Code 65852.2):
- Apply to residential zones (R-R)
- State law provides baseline rights
- County can add reasonable restrictions

**Secondary Dwellings** (per Solano County Code):
- Apply to agricultural zones (A-20, A-40, etc.)
- Different rules than standard ADUs
- Often require minimum lot sizes

## State ADU Law Basics (SB 9, AB 68, etc.)

California state law generally allows:
- One ADU per single-family lot
- One JADU (converted from existing space)
- Both an ADU and JADU on the same lot

### ADU Size Limits (State Baseline)
- Detached: Up to 1,200 sq ft
- Attached: Up to 50% of primary dwelling or 1,200 sq ft
- JADU: Up to 500 sq ft (must be within primary dwelling footprint)

### What Counties Cannot Restrict
State law prohibits local jurisdictions from:
- Requiring owner-occupancy (until 2025, then varies)
- Requiring parking if near transit
- Setting minimum lot sizes for attached ADUs
- Charging excessive impact fees

## Solano County Specific Rules

### Rural Residential Zones (R-R-5, R-R-10)
- ADUs generally permitted per state law
- Setbacks and height limits apply
- Septic capacity must be verified
- Water availability must be confirmed

### Agricultural Zones (A-20, A-40, A-80, A-160)
**Different rules apply!**

Agricultural zones use "secondary dwelling" provisions:
- Often require minimum lot size (e.g., 20 acres in A-20)
- May be limited to one secondary dwelling
- Tied to agricultural use of property
- Not the same permitting path as residential ADUs

### Common Requirements (All Zones)
1. **Building Permit** - Always required
2. **Septic Evaluation** - Environmental Health review
3. **Water** - Adequate water supply verification
4. **Fire** - May need fire district review in FHSZ
5. **Flood** - Additional requirements if in SFHA

## Fire Hazard Zones

Properties in Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ) may require:
- Enhanced construction (Chapter 7A compliance)
- Defensible space (100 ft in Very High FHSZ)
- Fire district review
- Additional setbacks from vegetation

## Flood Zones

Properties in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) must:
- Elevate lowest floor above Base Flood Elevation
- Obtain floodplain development permit
- May face additional restrictions

## Process Overview

### Typical ADU Approval Path
1. Pre-application meeting (recommended)
2. Submit building permit application
3. Environmental Health septic review
4. Fire district review (if applicable)
5. Building plan check
6. Permit issuance
7. Construction
8. Final inspections

### Typical Timeline
- Simple projects: 4-8 weeks for permit
- Complex projects: 3-6 months
- State law requires 60-day turnaround for ministerial approvals

## Costs

### County Fees (Approximate)
- Building permit: Based on valuation
- Plan check: ~65% of permit fee
- Septic review: ~$300-500
- Impact fees: Varies (state limits for ADUs)

### Development Costs
- Prefab ADUs: $100,000-200,000+
- Site-built ADUs: $150,000-400,000+
- Garage conversions: $50,000-150,000

*Costs vary significantly by site conditions, especially for septic and utilities.*

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"State law overrides everything"**
   - State law provides minimums, but local rules for setbacks, design, etc. still apply

2. **"I can build an ADU on any lot"**
   - Agricultural zones have different rules
   - Must have adequate septic/water

3. **"No permits needed for small ADUs"**
   - Building permits always required
   - Unpermitted ADUs create legal/insurance issues

4. **"I can rent it out as short-term rental"**
   - Short-term rental rules vary
   - Some areas prohibit or restrict vacation rentals
