# Standard GIS Disclaimers

## Primary Disclaimer (Include with all property-specific responses)

> **Disclaimer**: This information is provided for reference purposes only. GIS data may contain errors and does not replace official records. For legal, financial, or permit decisions, please verify with the appropriate department and consult official documents.

## When to Use Which Disclaimer

### Property Information Queries
> This parcel information is derived from GIS data and assessor records. It may not reflect recent changes. For official property records, contact the Solano County Assessor's Office at (707) 784-6200 or visit the Assessor's website.

### Zoning Queries
> Zoning shown is for general reference only. Zoning does not guarantee development rights - permits are required for most construction. For official zoning determinations and permit requirements, contact [City/County] Planning at [phone number].

### Flood Zone Queries
> Flood zone information shown is derived from FEMA's National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL). For official flood zone determinations for insurance or lending purposes, obtain a Flood Zone Determination from a certified provider or contact FEMA. Properties may qualify for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) if they can demonstrate they are above the Base Flood Elevation.

### Fire Hazard Zone Queries
> Fire Hazard Severity Zone (FHSZ) data is provided by CAL FIRE and the State Board of Forestry. FHSZ affects building standards and vegetation management requirements. For specific requirements for your property, contact your local fire district or the Solano County Fire Marshal.

### Assessment/Value Queries
> Assessed values shown are subject to Proposition 13 limitations and may not reflect current market value. The assessed value is recalculated upon change of ownership or new construction. For questions about your assessment, contact the Solano County Assessor's Office.

### Boundary Queries
> Property boundaries shown are approximate and derived from assessor parcel maps. They should not be used for legal boundary determination. For precise boundary locations, consult a licensed surveyor and recorded subdivision maps.

### Special District Queries
> Special district boundaries and services shown are for general reference. For specific service availability and connection requirements, contact the individual district directly.
